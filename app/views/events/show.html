					Our favorite meals have always been those we’ve shared in the homes of our family and friends. To celebrate our marriage and the gathering of our community, we want to recreate that type of meal with all of you. To that end, we’re hosting a wedding potluck! You’re invited to participate by bringing a dish that’s meaningful to you -- an old family recipe, something that you love to eat, or something that you’re excited to make and share with others.
					We’ll provide a main dish, cake, and beverages. We can’t wait to celebrate with all of you and share a meal that’s full of history, made with love, and thoughtfully created by the people we care about the most. Participating in the potluck is entirely up to you -- if you’re unable or don’t want to participate, that is perfectly okay. Either way, we’re so excited to share this day with you!

					that. We are so thankful for you!
